# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Author

I made this for myself by folliwing https://github.com/ErickKS/vite-react-router. Shout out to Erick!
You can fork the repo, but I don`t guarantee that it will work fine. If you encounter any issues, head to the original repo made by Erick and follow his tutorial.

# Features

This is a React app made with the latest version of Vite. It is written in TypeScript. The React Router is added as well, to navigate between pages. The workflow is set to deploy to GitHub Pages on push to the main branch. You can change this behavior by editing the .github/workflows/deploy.yml file.
